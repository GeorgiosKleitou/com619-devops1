# SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS AE1 Group Project

I need to you to submit a snapshot of your project on SOL before the submission deadline. This will be used by the examiner to audit your work.
If you do not submit on time on SOL, your work cannot be assessed as delivered on time.

HOWEVER, I will be marking your group project as it exists online on github.
I also need you to post your video on Youtube and link to it from the README page of your repository. 

Please do the following when handing in the AE1 group project

1. ALL members of your team should submit the following on SOL in your individual submission link
2. Submit your group video on SOL. (Please make sure it fits within the 250mb upload limit - you may need to down convert it)
3. Upload the highest resolution version of your group video to youtube and link to it from the README page of your group repository. 
4. Download a snapshot of your repository from github ( zip) and upload this to SOL. Make sure it fits within the upload limit and that you remove and/or do not submit any jars or npm packages which are built by your project and  should be excluded from git by .gitignore.
5. Also submit a single text file with the urls of your github repo, demo and video and the names of the people in your team.
   
In class, can you also MAKE SURE that the team details on the [github teams page](../Assessment/Teams.md)  are correct.
This should contain the same team information as the submitted text file mentioned above.
